# Netflix-Movie-Data-Analysis-

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of 10,000 Netflix movies using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The aim is to explore trends in genres, popularity scores, release years, and overall movie characteristics through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

The project answers key questions such as:

1. Which genre appears most frequently?
2. Which genres receive the highest votes?
3. Which movies are the most and least popular?
4. Which year has the highest number of movie releases?
5. Which year has the most filmmed movies?

Through data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization, this project provides meaningful insights into Netflix’s movie catalog and viewer preferences.
